          Life is full of surprises! Ask me, I am a web developer who has a
          business and commerce background with my UG degree in Mass
          Communications and my PG degree in International Marketing. 2 years
          ago, when I came back to India after completing my PG, I never thought
          I would be making my own websites someday.

          I still remember the first HTML markup that I wrote. When I saw "Hello
          World" getting printed on the browser window, I legit got goosebumps.

            Before stepping into the Tech world, I was at that same old place
            where atleast once, everyone of you have stood in your lives. And
            that is <strong>Finding the Right Career</strong>. <br /><br />
            My willingness to do something creative and artistic initially
            pushed me towards Mass Communications, that I did from Amity
            University, Noida. There, I did a radio show, organized an event at
            the Annual Festival, made a short film, learnt
            <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>. But I was most passionate about
            photography. (<a

              >Visit my photography page</a
            >) <br /><br />
            These 3 years of my graduation, one area that always had my interest
            was Social Media and I was deeply inspired by the
            <strong>Digital Makreting</strong>
            techniques. That's why I pursued International Marketing from the
            University of Law, London (Berlin campus).
            <br /><br />
            My creative instinct pushed me one more time this time when I was
            looking for a job. I worked as a
            <strong>Content Marketing Intern</strong> in a Berlin-based startup.

            While applying for jobs in digital marketing, I came across HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript in many job descriptions. On doing some research,
            I realized that a CS degree is not needed to become a developer.
            <br /><br />
            With <em>Knowledge</em>, <em>Skill</em> and <em>Practice</em>,
            anyone can do it. Not to forget how insanely creative and intense
            web development is. I followed my instinct and just went for it.
            <br /><br />
            What started off as an effort to boost my former career turned into
            a 9 month grind that put me where I am right now -

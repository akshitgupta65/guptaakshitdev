          Life is full of surprises! Ask me, I am a web developer who has a
          business and commerce background with my UG degree in Mass
          Communications and my PG degree in International Marketing. 2 years
          ago, when I came back to India after completing my PG, I never thought
          I would be making my own websites someday.

            Before stepping into the Tech world, I was at that same old place
            where atleast once, everyone of you have stood in your lives. And
            that is <strong>Finding the Right Career</strong>. <br /><br />
            My willingness to do something creative and artistic initially
            pushed me towards Mass Communications, that I did from Amity
            University, Noida. There, I did a radio show, organized an event at
            the Annual Festival, made a short film, learnt
            <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>. But I was most passionate about
            photography. (<a href="#">Visit my photography page</a>)
            <br /><br />
            These 3 years of my graduation, one area that always had my interest
            was Social Media and I was deeply inspired by the Digital Makreting
            techniques. That's why I did International Marketing from the
            University of Law, London (Berlin campus).
            <br /><br />
            My creative instinct pushed me one more time this time when I was
            looking for a job. I worked as a Content Marketing Intern in a
            Berlin-based startup.

            While applying for jobs in digital marketing, I came across HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript in many job descriptions. On doing some research,
            I realized that I dont need a CS degree to become a developer.
            <br /><br />
            Anyone with the knowledge, skill and some practise can do it. I
            realized how insanely creative and intense web development is. Also,
            you see knowledge is never harmful, infact this knowledge is
            beneficial in digital marketing. So, I went for it.
            <br /><br />
            What started off as an effort to boost my former career turned into
            a 9 month grind that put me where I am right now -
            <br /><br />
            A Frontend Web Developer looking for opportunities to kick-start my
            career.

          Life is full of surprises! Ask me, I am a web developer who has a
          business and commerce background with UG degree in Mass Communications
          and PG degree in International Marketing. At that time, I never
          thought I would be making my own websites someday.

          I remember the first HTML markup that I wrote. When I saw "Hello
          World" getting printed on the browser window, I legit got goosebumps.

            Before stepping into the Tech world, I was at that same old place
            where everyone has to stand in their lives atleast once. And that is
            <strong>Finding the Right Career</strong>. <br /><br />
            My willingness to do something creative and artistic initially
            pushed me towards Mass Communications. There, I did a radio show,
            organized an event at the Annual Festival, made a short film, learnt
            <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, but
            <strong>Photography</strong> was something that I was most
            passionate about. <br />
            <a

              >Visit my photography page ➡️
            </a>
            <br /><br />
            At that time, Social Media was something that always held my interest. I was deeply inspired by
            <strong>Digital Makreting</strong>. That's why I decided to pursue International Marketing.
            <br /><br />
            My creative instinct pushed me again when I was looking for a job. I
            worked as a
            <strong>Content Marketing Intern</strong> where I created content
            for blogs and newsletters.
            <br />
            <a class="inline_links" target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lR6SQeoZUK5s7ZJ1eZGXf9kaZVAIlO_y/view?usp=sharing">Open Resume ↘️</a>

        <div class="tab_content tab_content--2">
          <p class="paragraph">
            While applying for jobs in digital marketing, I came across HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript in many job descriptions. On doing some research,
            I realized I don't need a CS degree to become a developer.
            <br /><br />
            With <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>skill</strong> and
            <strong>practice</strong>, anyone can do it. Not to forget how
            insanely creative and intense web development is. I followed my
            instinct and just went for it. <br /><br />
            What started off as an effort to boost my former career turned into
            a 1-year grind that put me where I am right now - <br /><br />
            <span class="blockquote">

                kick-start my career</q

          <p class="paragraph">
            One of the key ingredients in becoming a competent web developer is
            continuous learning and increasing our knowledge database. It is
            pivotal for a budding developer to be familiar with industry
            standards and must have the ability to work with popular libraries
            and frameworks.
            <br /><br />
            My next step is to learn <strong>jQuery</strong>. Another
            high-in-demand library that I am really looking forward to is
            <strong>React</strong>. Finally, to learn about designing resposive
            webpages, I would master <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. <br /><br />
            That's why I have started a course on
            <strong>freeCodeCamp.org</strong> that is not only teaching me
            everything I need at this stage, but also giving me projects to work
            and learn. <br />
